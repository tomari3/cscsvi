# 2	Origins of Domain Specificity: The Evolution of Functional Organization

- There are strong connection between domain-specific machinery and evolutionary psychology
- modular traits can be seen as evolutionary process acting on out hunter gatherer ancestors

## 2.1	Natural Selection and Ancestral Environments
- The human brain is product of evolution and its 2 main forces: chance and natural selection
- Complex functional design cannot be explained solely as product of chance
	- The only explanation for these systems (motor, language, etc) is natural selection
	- Cognitive psychologists benefit from studying adaptations and their effect.
- Natural selection work by testing different designs for lasting problems through encounters
	- The metric is how spread they become
	- Function of a design relates only to how it helped spreading
- Evolution is an historical process with no foresight
	- Statistical system
	- Mechanisms are relevant to their time of creation and are not necessarily exhaustive of out solving potential
- Ergo its illogical to think that functions are designed to deal with "classes" of problems other than those relevant at the time
	- Solving current problems cannot explain how the design came to be
	- Successful solving of current problems is a mere consequence of the original design
	- Only simulation of the problems made to be solved can be used as an explanatory
- Reproduction is an aim but not the only one
	- Preconditions are necessary to achieve reproduction
	- We have evolved many sets of skills
- Illusion of useless / unnecessary functions happen when we view them outside the context of their creation
	- To understand the cause of our systems we must look at the Computational Level. The first level of Marr's framework
- Systems created by evolutions are not "perfect" (whatever that means) by they are pretty damn near it.
- Two questions:
	1. What architecture is capable of solving the dynamic problems out ancestors had? domain-general or domain-specific?
	2. If theres an adaptive problem that can be solved by one of these, which is it more likely to be?

### 2.1.1	What's Wrong with Domain-General Mechanisms: An Evolutionary Perspective
- Reasons against the brain being a general purpose machine
-  Important problem = evolution hard at work. Its easier to allocate resources when encapsulated. Similar to body organs. Heart to pump blood, liver for toxins etc. A signal general solution will be inferior to two specialized ones. 
- Pray animals have "alarm clocks" for different threats. they develop traits to avoid them. flight, diving, scanning and more. A general purpose system will be slower to act than a specific system for each threat 
- The human mind can be expected to contain several functionally distinct specializations
- To expect to different cognitive mechanisms to be alike is like expecting the spleen and eyes to be alike 
- Development of the mind is governs by statistical distribution of past situations our ancestors encountered
- Argument against the plausibility of domain-general mechanisms to adapt and survive
	- ground rules:
		1. To be viable hypothesis, the design must be able to solve its target problem
		2. Enhanced functionality is the only criteria natural selection responds to
	- Domain-general cannot guie behavior in ways that promote fitness for at least three reasons:
		1. Definition of fitness changes between domains
		2. Adaptive systems cannot be learned by domain-general systems as they are statistical and are in a larger time frame than human's life
		3. Combinatorial explosion paralyzes domain-general systems when seeing real-world complexity
1. **The Definition of Error is Domain-Dependent**
	- Success is defined differently between domains. 
	- Generalizing success from one domain to another (in a domain specific system) can result in wrong generalizations
	- Traditionally psychologists look for acquisition of knowledge rather than for regulation of action
	- Knowledge acquisition is evolved because it was important in regulation of successful action!
2. **Many Relationships Necessary to the Successful Regulation of Action Cannot be Observed by Any Individual During Lifetime** 
	- Domain-general architecture is limited to one lifetime's knowledge through perception alone.
		- Domain-specific design is all around us: snakes are venomous, objects are solid, human speech is consistent
		- Domain-general system cannot distinguish these specific regions from start, but to generalize into them based on perception
		- Chomsky argument against the poverty of stimuli in language as a basis of innate trait is similar
	- Natural selection "counts up" the results of alternative designs operation in the real world, over millions of individuals and weights them statistically
3. **Combinatorial Explosion Paralyzes Any System that is Truly Domain-General**
	- Some mechanisms might be domain-general but as a whole its combinatorially impossible as the number of combinations increase with the number of inputs exponentially. 

## 2.2	Evolutionary biology, computational theories, and learnability
- Evolutionary perspective can help research by
	1. Pinpoint important problems for which we have adaptive specialization
	2. Define the theories for the cause of functionalities
### 2.2.1	Evolvability Constraints and Computational Theories
- Natural selection is a theory of *function* helps pinpoint problems that were selected to solve
- Computational theory suggest what possible mechanisms each function uses
- W. D. Hamilton kin selection theory suggested a reason of a kin to help, which seems counter intuitive as it lowers the fitness of the helping individual by choice
	- Game theory mathematical system found that and equilibrium of spreading happens when $[\text{Cost to self} < (\text{Benefit to kin member} \times (\text{coefficient of relatedness to kin member}))]$ 
	- This is an evolutionary constraint: a definition of what counts as adaptive behaviour
- To actually use adaptive theories the subject must have two things
	1. Some way of extracting information relevant to the problems variables
	2. Rules that uses the information in the scope of the theories constraints
	- We have an evolutionary kin to help, ergo we should expect mechanisms that are dedicated to solving problems as above quickly, efficiently, automatically.
