  - **Services:** Contain the business logic and interact with the game engine.
  - **Repositories:** Manage data persistence if needed (e.g., storing game states, player data).
  - **Entities/Models:** Represent game objects like `Game`, `Player`, `Board`, `Card`.

- **Layered Architecture:**
  - Organize your code into layers (e.g., Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access).

### **6.2. Dependency Injection**

- **Usage in Spring Boot:**
  - Leverage Spring's dependency injection to manage your components.
  
  ```java
  @Service
  public class GameService {
      // Business logic
  }
  
  @Controller
  public class GameController {
      
      private final GameService gameService;
      
      @Autowired
      public GameController(GameService gameService) {
          this.gameService = gameService;
      }
      
      // Handle WebSocket messages
  }
  ```

### **6.3. Testing and Quality Assurance**

  - Use JUnit and Mockito for writing unit tests for your game logic.
  
  ```java
  @RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)
  public class GameServiceTest {
      
      @Mock
      private GameRepository gameRepository;
      
      @InjectMocks
      private GameService gameService;
      
      @Test
      public void testProcessGuess() {
          // Test guess processing logic
      }
  }
  ```

- **Integration Testing:**
  - Test the interaction between different components (e.g., WebSocket controllers and services).
  - Use Spring's testing framework for integration tests.
  
  ```java
  @RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
  @SpringBootTest
  public class GameControllerIntegrationTest {
      
      @Autowired
      private GameController gameController;
      
      @Test
      public void testHandleGameAction() {
          // Integration test logic
      }
  }
  ```

- **Code Quality Tools:**
  - Use tools like **SonarQube**, **Checkstyle**, and **PMD** to maintain code quality.

### **6.4. Documentation and Maintainability**

- **API Documentation:**
  - Use **Swagger** to document your WebSocket endpoints and APIs.
  
  ```java
  // Example with Swagger annotations
  @ApiOperation(value = "Handle game action", notes = "Processes game actions like guesses and clues.")
  @MessageMapping("/game-action")
  @SendTo("/topic/game-updates")
  public GameMessage handleGameAction(GameMessage message) {
      // Handler logic
  }
  ```

- **Code Comments and Javadoc:**
  - Document your classes and methods for better maintainability.

### **6.5. Security Best Practices**
