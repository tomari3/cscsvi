- **One Man Show or an Orchestra?** Is the brain a versatile “Swiss Army Knife” or a collection of specialized tools, like an orchestra of musicians?

	- [[fMRI]] results show specialized sections connected to various abilities, including:
	
	- Sensory and motor processes
	
	- High-level perceptual analysis of faces, places, bodies, words
	
	- Abstract cognitive functions like empathy

- **Key Questions:**

	- How much of the brain is specialized?
	
	- How does specialization arise?

  

## 1.1	Introduction

  

- **Objective:** Infer the architecture of the mind based on functional organization data from [[fMRI]].

- **Historical Context:** [[Franz Joseph Gall]] proposed the brain is composed of distinct faculties; later consensus agreed that basic sensory and motor functions are driven by specialized brain regions.

- **Present Questions:**

	1. **Degree of Specialization:** How specialized are these regions? Many challenge the notion of strong exclusive functional specialization.
	
	2. **Scope of Specialization:** Is specialization limited to basic functions, or does it extend to higher-level functions?

- **Argument:** There are a few brain regions incredibly specialized for single high-level functions.

- **Focus:**

	- Three candidate areas
	
	- Extent of brain specialization
	
	- Specialization in high-level functions and abstract thought
	
	- Development of these regions

	- Discussion on the [[fusiform face area]] and [[parahippocampal place area]]

  

## 1.2	Neuroimaging Evidence for Functional Specialization in the Ventral Visual Pathway

  

- Lesion studies provide some evidence for localization but have limitations.

- [[fMRI]] allows precise, noninvasive monitoring of healthy brain functions.

- **Specialized Areas:**

	- [[fusiform face area|FFA]]: responds selectively to faces
	
	- [[parahippocampal place area|PPA]]: responds selectively to places
	
	- [[extrastriate body area|EBA]]: responds selectively to bodies and body parts
	
	- [[MT/V5]]: responds selectively to visual motion perception
	
	- Other candidates for color, biological motion, reaching, and grasping

- **Key Arguments:**

- **Uniformity:** Each region consistently observed across studies and labs

- **Strong Reactions:** Regions respond twice as strongly to preferred stimuli

- **Region of Interest (ROI):** Regions can be easily found in healthy subjects

  

### 1.2.1	[[fusiform face area|FFA]]

  

- **Location:** Mid fusiform gyrus on the bottom surface of the [[cerebral cortex]], just above the [[cerebellum]]

- **Function:** Responds to faces

	- Responds similarly to various kinds of faces
	
	- Familiar and unfamiliar faces
	
	- Schematic and cartoon faces
	
	- Animal faces (e.g., cats)
	
	- Faces from different locations and viewpoints
	
	- Strong role in face recognition; minor role in non-face recognition
	
	- Lesions can cause deficits in face perception
	
	- Especially reactive to specific facial features

- **Questions:**

	- What precise representations does it extract?
	
	- How does it compute?
	
	- Connections with other regions?

  

### 1.2.2	[[parahippocampal place area|PPA]]

  

- **Location:** Adjacent to the collateral sulcus in the parahippocampal cortex

- **Function:** Responds more strongly to images of scenes than objects

	- Wide variety of scenes
	
	- Indoor and outdoor
	
	- Familiar and unfamiliar
	
	- Abstract scenes (e.g., Lego structures)
	
	- Sensitive to spatial layout
	
	- Lesions can cause difficulties in encoding spatial layouts

- **Questions:** The precise role of PPA in perception and navigation remains under investigation

  

### 1.2.3	[[extrastriate body area|EBA]]

  

- **Location:** Lateral surface of the brain, adjacent to the visual motion area MT

- **Function:** Responds strongly to images of bodies and body parts

	- Responds to various depictions of bodies
	
	- Hands, human and animal bodies
	
	- Stick figures and schematics
	
	- Lesions affect perception of bodies, faces, and objects
	
	- More involved in perceiving others’ bodies than one’s own
	
	- Focused on form/identity rather than actions

  

### 1.2.4	Ovals, Gradients, or Archipelagoes

  

- **Different Shapes, Different Borders:** Some areas are well-defined; others are not

	- Regions may not be contiguous but functionally similar
	
	- The stronger the function relation, the more distinct the borders
	
	- Evidence suggests compartmentalization in some cortical regions
	
	- Strong evidence for selective engagement in specific cognitive functions by FFA, PPA, and EBA

  

## 1.3	How Much of the Brain is Composed of Functionally Specific Regions?

  

- Existence of specialized areas raises questions about other functionalities:

	1. Other categories in the ventral visual pathways
	
	2. Components of high-level thoughts

  

### 1.3.1	Other Category-Selective Regions

  

- **Specificity of Functions:**
	
	- Perception of snakes, weapons, vegetables, etc.
	
	- Insufficient space for specialized areas for all categories

- **Testing Various Categories:**

	- 20 categories based on evolutionary significance, experience, prior studies
	
	- Only faces, places, and bodies showed selective areas

- **Approach to Testing:**

	- Avoid preconceptions to prevent limitations
	
	- Examine a wide variety of brain areas and correlations
	
	- Even without presumed stimulus categories, functional brain areas can be found

- **Selective Cortical Regions for Aspects of Thought:**

	- One-third of the cortex is allocated for vision
	
	- **Region for Others’ Thoughts:**
	
	- Identified _jTPJ_, active when thinking about others’ thoughts
	
	- Most specialized high-level area found
	
	- Suggests possibility of other specialized regions

- **Language Regions:**

	- Lesions suggest areas like Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas
	
	- Neuroimaging shows overlap between linguistic and non-linguistic areas
	
	- Overlap may be due to variability in individual brains or study techniques
	
	- Function may be structured by computation type rather than subject matter

- **Open Questions:**

	- Which functions have dedicated areas?
	
	- Are some areas unique to humans?
	
	- Reverse-engineering these areas could reveal origins

- **Limitations:**

	- Current tools are inadequate for measuring neural circuits of cognitive abilities

## 1.4	Origins: How Do Functionally Specific Regions Arise Developmentally

- **Experience Versus Genes:**
	- Is the nature for specialized areas are innate, as in evolutionary, or are they learned, by reiteration and experience?
	- Recent evidence suggests that areas of face recognition are primarily genetic while other, near regions, might be modeled by experience

### 1.4.1	Specific Role of Genes in Face Perceptions

- **Genetic Evidence:**
	1. Prosopagnosia; A disorder in face-perception run in families
	2. Face-perception ability is heritable and effected by IQ and global attention
	3. fMRI scans of facial recognition pathways is closer in monozygotic, than in dizygotic twins
		- same for scenes but not for chairs or words
	- So genes are involved, but we don't know which, and what they affect
	- Even with absent of faces in babies, neural pathways for recognition are present, further solidify the genome theorem
	- **Fine-Tuning:**
		- Although an innate ability is present, familiarity and experience affect how we perceive faces.
		- It is common knowledge that people have harder time recognizing faces of unfamiliar races ("They all look alike")
		- Similar phenomena is seen in language development
### 1.4.2	At Least One Functionally Specific Cortical Region Derives Its Specificity from Experience

- **Visual Word Recognition:**
	- Humans began reading only a few thousand years ago, considered not enough time for evolution to construct a complex structure
	- Finding a brain area that responds to written words would suggest that the behavior is learned
	- A tiny region, tenth the size of [[fusiform face area]] found to be selective of that task
- **Questions:**
	- Can it be developed in an alternate location in the case of a lesion?

## 1.5	Conclusions

- Technology drives new findings and studies
- The first step is a "part list" of specialized brain areas and their functions
- Why are these regions are systematically in those specific regions?
- How are the neural pathways to achieve the wanted function computation?
- Are there cases where a region arise in several occasions, or changes its place?
- Can regions change or adapt their function?
- What is the scope of a specialized region like the FFA? Recognition alone or reason, race, sex, etc.?
