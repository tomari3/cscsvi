# 1	The Place of Modeling in Cognitive Science
- We should consider models as tools to experiment the implication of our ideas
	- simplification is necessary and hard. poor fit doesn't discard the idea and a good fit doesn't crown it. 

## 1.1	The role of the computer in the early days of cognitive science
- The computer gave rise to Functionalism and helped diminish Behaviourism
- **Newell and Simon's Logic Theorem Prover**
	- The two created a program that can prove logic theorems based on axioms
- **Rosenblatt's Perceptron**
	- Rosenblatt claimed a true marvel of computation is to get the machine to learn any function anyone wanted, not to be used as a programming tool. 
- **Neural networks meet overpowering limitation**
	1. Rosenblatt though perceptrons should be binary (McCullogh-Pitts neuron), leaving out derivatives and gradient descent
	2. Rossenblatt was limited by the slow computers of the time. 
- **The resurgence of neural networks**
	- Grossberg (1978) and James Anderson (1977)
		- continuous rather than discrete activation
		- derivative of activation function
		- learning from hidden layers using back propagation
		- a XOR problem took Rumelhart's algorithms a full night to solve. today it takes a fraction of a second

## 1.2	The nature and roles of models in cognitive science
### 1.2.1	Using models to explore the implications of ideas

$$
\frac{da_{il}}{d_{t}}=k_{l}(v_{il}(t)-a_{il}(t)), \text{ where } v_{il}= \sum_{j}w_{il}a_{jl-1}(t) 
$$

### 1.2.2	The issue of simplification
