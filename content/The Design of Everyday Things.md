Here is a consice summary by me of the book "The Design on Everyday Things" by Don Norman

---

## 0.1	Preface

- **Ubiquity of Manufactured Items**: We use manufactured items all the time—they are designed to make life easier.

- **Design Failures**: Sometimes products fail, require complicated instructions, or have unused features due to poor design.

- **Exploring Poor Designs**: We will examine examples of failed designs from the modern world.

- **Prioritizing Usability**: Usability and understandability are often more important than aesthetics.

- **Benefits of Proper Design**:
	
	- Minimizes errors and failures
	
	- Saves money
	
	- Increases user morale

- **User-Centered Design**: Design should be based on people’s needs and interests.

- **Avoid Self-Indulgent Design**: Overly clever or sophisticated designs can be self-indulgent and hinder usability.

## 0.2	The Importance of Good Design

- **Challenges with Poorly Designed Products**:

	- Even intelligent people struggle with seemingly simple tasks due to poor product design.

- **Characteristics of Good Design**:

	- Provides clear clues on how to use the product.
	
	- Functions should be obvious to untrained users.
	
	- Incorporates familiar concepts that users already know.
	
	- Offers instructions and visible clues while keeping things simple.

- **Visibility**:

- **Definition**: Showing the mapping between actions and operations, or between the device and its results.

- **Psychology of Interaction**:

	- Understanding user interaction with everyday objects is crucial for good design.

  

# 1	The Psychopathology of Everyday Things

  

## 1.1	Affordance

- **Definition**: How objects are perceived and how they can actually be used.

- **Examples**:

	- A chair affords support; therefore, it affords sitting.
	
	- Glass affords seeing through, breaking, or carving.
	
	- Flat surfaces afford writing on.
	
	- Wood is solid and flat; it affords writing on.

- **Significance**: Affordances provide strong clues to the operations of things.

- **Design Failures**:

	- When simple items require instructions, the design has failed.

- **User Interaction**:

	- Users correlate actions with results; no results indicate incorrect actions.
	
	- We use hundreds of objects daily with specialized uses.
	
	- Quick and easy learning is crucial.
	
	- Good design leverages what users expect and already know.

  

## 1.2	Conceptual Models

  

- **Simulating How Things Work**:

	- Users simulate functionality using affordances, constraints, mapping, parts, and implications.

- **Feedback**:

	- Immediate feedback helps users understand the design model.

## 1.3	Making Things Visible

  

## 1.4	Principles of Visibility

- **Single Control, Single Function**: Each control corresponds to one function, providing clear feedback.

- **Logical Relationships**: Establish reasonable relationships between controls and their effects.

- **Labels and Intuition**: Use labels to enhance intuitive understanding.

- **Effective Reminders**: Provide cues for what can be done and how, reducing the need for memory.

  

## 1.5	Mapping

  

- **Definition**:

	- The relationship between controls, movements, and results.

- **Examples**:

	- Turning the steering wheel left causes the wheels to turn left, making the car turn left.

- **Natural Mapping**:

	- Uses physical analogies and cultural standards for immediate understanding.

- **Key Principle**:

- **Controls Should Be Where Users Expect Them to Be**: Placement of controls should make sense to the user.
  
## 1.6	Feedback

  

- **Importance**:

	- Feedback is essential for users to understand the effects of their actions.

	- Immediate and clear feedback helps prevent errors and aids learning.

  

## 1.7	Iterative Design and Cost Considerations

  

- **Combining Functionality with Aesthetics**:

	- Integrate functionality with visual clues and aesthetics when possible.

- **Guiding the User**:

	- Provide subtle hints to direct users toward correct usage.

	- Prevent improper use effectively but unobtrusively.

- **Design Iterations**:

	- Good design typically requires about 5–6 iterations and revisions.

	- Many new designs fail by the third attempt due to insufficient refinement.

- **Minimizing Complexity and Cost**:

	- Added complexity increases difficulty.

	- Aim to minimize errors and reduce costs through effective design.

  

## 1.8	Minimizing Complexity and Errors

  

- **Simplify Design**:

	- Reduce unnecessary complexity to make products easier to use.

- **Error Reduction**:

	- Effective design minimizes the chance of user errors.

  

# 2	Everyday Actions

- **Enhancing User Experience**:

	- Recognize the importance of intuitive design in everyday objects.

	- Good design makes daily tasks effortless and intuitive

## 2.1	Self Blame

- people easily take blame when falsly operate an object
- assume all errors will occur, aim for prevention

## 2.2	Misconceptions

- **Naive Physics:** We have a naive view of a lot of things, like say physics

- **Mental Models:** We explain and predicts things based on expectations and previous knowledege, even if naive, imaginary or plain wrong. We use objects based on these models 

- **Wrong Tree:** 
	- Coincidence is enough to set the casual wheels rolling
	- Faulty blame happends a lot with lack of information, provide relevant info for correct blame

- **Learned Helplessness:** Repeated failure may lead to the belief that a task cannot be done, at least not by the failed party

- **Taught Helplessness:** Creating a difficult or intimidating experience can lead to Learned Helplessness, as in Mathematics Phobia in a lot of children, drag on to adulthood.

- **Human Reason:**

	- Its really hard to accuratly assess the cause of failure in a complicated product / proccess
	- Past experience often determine the expected cause of failure
	- The first reasonable explanation is often the one adopted

## 2.3	The Seven Stages of Action

### 2.3.1	Approximation Model

1. **Goal:** What I want to achieve
2. **Intention:** A plan for achieving the goal
3. **Action:** Specify actions based on the intention
4. **Execute:** Bring the action to life
5. **Preceive:** Observe the outcome of the execution
6. **Interpret:** Make sense of what is precieved
7. **Evaluate:** Compare what happened and what was wanted

- This model performes a cycle from Goal to Execution to Evaluation back to Goal
- Most models benefit from circumstances; are Opportunistic, alas, require less effort to formulate
- Each step is often ill formed and flawed, as most of the time, we are not logical, reasoning organisms. We respond rather than plan

### 2.3.2	Gulf of Execution and Evaluation

-  Most design problems lay not in the Goal step but in the mapping between mental intentions and interpetations and the physical actions and states. Will call these gaps between mental states and physical states *Gulfs*

- **Gulf of Execution:** The difference between the intentions and the allowable actions; How well does the system allows the person to do the intended action directly
- **Gulf of Evaluation:** The amount of effort that a person must exert to interpret the physical state of a system and determine how well the expectation and intentions have been met

## 2.4	The Seven Stages of Action as Design Aids

- **Good Conceptual Model:** Consistent and coherent presentation of operations and results
- **Good Mapping:** Relationships between actions and results, controls and effects, state and visibility
- **Feedback:** Continuous feedback about the results of actions

- Hard to use object $=$ Bad design
- Easy to use object $=$ Good design. Appreciate it, its not by chance

# 3	Knowledege in the Head and in the World

- **Human memory is weak:** Give reminders where needed, clues, visuals, literal guides, patterns, etc.
1. **Information is in the world:** Behaviour is determined by combination of information in memory and in the world
2. **Great precision is not required:** Sufficient distinguishion succesfully guides behviour
3. **Natural constraints:** The limits of an object give constraint to its usage, and can be used to guide its use. 
4. **Cultural constraints:** Conventions and traditions and highten or hinder a design. Use them wisely. 

## 3.1	Information is in the World

- Disregarding user's information and abilities, the information to do a task must be present in the world.
- The ability of people to opt and learn should be incouraged and possible, without constraints on those who dont. e.g a keyboard has this relationship
- Tradeoff between quality and effort
- Information to be memorized needs to be accurate just enough to sustain the quality of behaviour you desire
- People organize their life in many styles, they organize information, physically and with relationships.
- We store only partial, key information about object. General size, color, relationships and what distighuish it from a group of similar or related objects.

## 3.2	The Power of Constraints

- **Constraints lower the mental workload:** fewer options = easier, correct decision

## 3.3	Memory is Knowledege in the Head

- Storing and retrieving memory is difficult
- Short term memory can only store so much, keep it small
- Long term memory takes time a effort to build, dont count on it, but use it. 
- LTM benefits and functions on structure and organization

1. **Memory for arbitrary things:** What is to be done, without reliance on understanding or structure. ABC, shoelaces. We usually manufactor some connections, to memorize. 
2. **Memory for meaningful relationships:** Things that connect, understood anc change based on relationship of pevious knowledge. Good mental mode provide good meaning and relationships. Give a meaningful relationship. 
3. **Memory through explanation:** Understanding. A good mental model simplifies learning. Let people derive appropriate behaviour for situations that are not remembered. People do that themselves, help them.
