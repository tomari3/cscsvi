# 1	pigeon hole principle

## 1.1	theorem

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{let } n\text{ and }k\text{ be positive integers and let }n<k. \\ \text{. Suppose we have to place }n\text{ identical balls into }k \\ \text{ identical boxes. Then there will be at least one box in which we place at least two balls}
\end{align*}
$$

## 1.2	proofs

1. Among eight integers there are always two whose difference is divisible by seven
	- assume 8 different integers k (balls). since they are different, the difference between A1 and A2 will be at least 1. since there are 8 integers, there are at least 7 diffrences (boxes), where the minimal difference would be the sequence 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. hence there are more balls than boxes and the proof follows. 
2. Six distinct positive integers such that none of them have a prime factor larger than 10. Prove that there are two integer that have a common prime divisor.
	- The set of prime numbers lesser than 10 is 2,3,5,7 of which its cardinality is 4. given six "boxes" of integer numbers that non of them are composed than a prime larger than 10 derives that its composed at most from 7 and a least from 2. there are n = 4 integers to place and 6 integers k to choose from. hence, n > k and the proof follows. same applied for any number of intergers that is larger than 4

# 2	The Generalized Pigeon Hole Principle

## 2.1	Theorem
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Let } n,m,r \text{ be positive integers such that } \\ n > rm \text{ let us distibute } n \text{ identical balls into } m \\ \text{ identical boxes. Than there will be at least one box into which we place at least } r + 1 \text{ balls}
\end{align*}
