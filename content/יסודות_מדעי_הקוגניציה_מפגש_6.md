# 1	מודלים חישוביים בקוגניציה
- תופס כקורס באנגלית?
- **Connecting the relevant sciences**
- **Realizing what is possible**

## 1.1	Questions, Scales and Outline
- The aim is mathematical modeling
- e.g: Neurons, and networks of neurons, organisms
	- Memory, Learning, High Cognitive functions
	- The scale of the subject dictates the complexity
		- A Neuron can have a differational equation of its activity, a network will be harder and organisms much harder
		- Moreover than technical difficulties the conceptual questions are getting tougher as well
			- Questions about a neuron are simpler than and different the those about organisms
			- We want answerable questions
	- Some subject are out of scope: genetic basis and microbial basis of cognitive phenomena
# 2	The courses Subjects
- Associative Memory
	- a model of memory
- Categorization
	- what and when can be categorized
- Supervised Learning
	- how we generalize learning
- Unsupervised Learning
	- categorization based on statistical analysis
- Reinforcement Learning
- Decision making in uncertainty
- Probability models in cognition 
	- $\mathcal{P}(A|B)=\frac{\mathcal{P}(B|A)\mathcal{P}(A)}{\mathcal{P}(B)}$
# 3	An Example of a Functional Model - Do Dogs Know Calculus?
- A man walks with his dog to the lake. Each time he throws the ball to the water the dog runs to the ball, jumping at a certain point, what is the dogs guiding princple?
	- Conjectures:
		- He want to minimize his run length
		- He want to minimize running one sand
		- He want to minimize being in water
		- He want to minimize energy
		- He want to minimize arrival time
	- Time minimization model

		- We will receive a linear equation
		- $y=\frac{x}{\sqrt{ (\frac{r}{s})^2 } - 1}$
# 4	Probability Theory and Everyday Cognition
- Asses an insurance case fo an 18 year old woman, what would be her lifespan?
- Predict the box office of a movie that took 10 million dollar so far
- models:
	- $t$ מייצג את הערך המוצג לנבדקים
	- $t_{t}$ מייצג את התחזית
	- $\mathcal{P}(t_{t}|t)$
	- $\mathcal{P}(t_{t}>t^*|t)=0.5$
- human prediction has a good match to probability theories
- people "know" these prior distributions and effectively adopt them
# 5	Inferring Network Design
- Memorization task
- Theres a single neuron that fires only according to a specific image
- What mathematical model can describe that mechanics
- Sigmoid function: $\delta(I)=S$
- Feedback - input is a fraction of the output
	- $I=JS, S=\delta(I)\implies S=\delta(JS)$
	- Three points intersection
	1. at 0
	2. at middle: changes based on fire rate
	3. at high: means theres a feedback loop
# Sex, strain and lateral differences in brain cytoarchitecture across a large mouse population
- Systematic brain-wide cell counting over hundreds of brains reveals non trivial relations between region volume and density
