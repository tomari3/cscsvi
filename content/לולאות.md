- used for repeptitive tasks
- important for itertaion through data structures

# 1	for loop
## 1.1	syntax
```java
for (init; cond; update) {
	//
}
```
## 1.2	when
- you know exactly how many times you want to repeat a block of code
## 1.3	exmaple
```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
	System.out.println(i);
}
```

# 2	while
## 2.1	syntax
```java
while (cond) {
	//
}
```
## 2.2	when
- you want to repeat a code as long as a condition is true, but you dont know how many iterations it will take
## 2.3	example
```java
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
	System.out.println(i);
	i++;
}
```

# 3	do...while
## 3.1	syntax
```java
do {
	//
} while (cond);
```
## 3.2	when
- you want to execute the code block at leat once before checking the condition
## 3.3	example
```java
int i = 0;
do {
	System.out.println(i);
	i++;
} while (i < 5);
```
# 4	for each
## 4.1	syntax
```java
for (dataType item : collection) {
	//
}
```
## 4.2	when
- you want to iterate through all elements in an array or collectoin without needing to know the index
## 4.3	example
```java
int[] nums = {1,2,3,4,5};
for (int num : nums) {
	System.out.println(num)
}
```
# 5	key points
- for loop when you know the number of iterations in advanced
- while loop when you dont know the number of iterations in advanced
- do while loop is like while loop, but it always executes atleast once
- enchanced loop simplifies iteration of over collections and arrays
# 6	testwise
- attention to init, cond and update
- not off by one errors, especially in arrays incdices
- watch out for infinite loops
- consider for each when you dont need the index going over a collection
