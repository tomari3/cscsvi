- the little questions
    1. vision
    2. action
    3. attention
    4. memory
    5. language
    
- the big questions
    1. the architecture of cognition
    2. localism or holism
    3. hierarchical or top-down processing
    
## 1.1	The Localistic Approach
- Different functions have different, distinct areas (specialization)
- What cognitive functions?
- By what resolution?
- How independant is each area?
- Is it innate or learnt?

# 2	Hisotrorical Review

## 2.1	19th century

### 2.1.1	Phrenology
- Franz Joseph Gall
- A view that says that there are specific brain ares of every mental function
- 27 centers (bilateral)
- basic cognitive functions (color, shape, language)
- high-level functions (emotion, faith and personality traits)

### 2.1.2	Anatomical Personology
- The greater the function, the greater the brain area (similar to muscle growth)
- Craniumetrics is a pseudoscience that study the brain by the shape of the head

### 2.1.3	Paul Broca
- found the Broca Area, for generating language
- found by aphasia, caused by seizure
- Supported Localism

### 2.1.4	Carl Wernicke
- Found Wernicke Area, for understanding and fluent language
- Suggest a model of connections between disassociated areas
- **Connectionism** with a sprinkle of localism

## 2.2	The Rise of Cognitive Psychology

### 2.2.1	We Start With Behaviorism
- The focus is solely on the observed behavior
	- All can be explained by reinforcement (the passive brain)
- Subjects feedback is not objective

### 2.2.2	The Cognitive Psychology Revolution
- Inside the "Black Box" we have an active mental system
	- innate and learnt, similar between people
	- Understanding behavior requires to understand mental processes
	- Cognition is an information-processing system
		- Functional systems study the "Software" and does not need to understand the "Hardware"
- Cognitive Psychology tries to break down the sub systems, connections and hierarchy of brain parts and cognitions
- How is information represented and what transformations are acted upon it
- Linear models of processing, like algorithms

### 2.2.3	Fodor: The Modularity of Mind (1983)
#### 2.2.3.1	Localization
- Cognitive Science should focus on 
	- specific functions that can be modeled (domain-specific/vertical faculties)
- And not focus on
	- general functions (domain-general/horizontal faculties)

#### 2.2.3.2	Vertical and Horizontal Structures
![[Pasted image 20241103171847.png]]
- General purpose functions ca not be modeled as we can control all the parameters

#### 2.2.3.3	Modularity
- Processing is done by areas that are
	1. Specific
	2. Fast
	3. Encapsulated
	4. Mandatory (Automatic)
	5. Innate

> We cant and should try to understand these high-level functions

## 2.3	The 1980's Return of the Brain

- **Key Finding in Neurophysiology:**
	- Disassociated ares for  disassociated vision functions in monkeys
		- The "what" channel 
		- The "where" channel
- **fMRI**

## 2.4	Functional Specialization
